# Quantum Principal Component Analysis on Amazon Braket

Along this notebook we implemented the Principal Component Analysis technique under the quantum computation paradigm. We implemented the PCA technique for the famous problem of house pricing in the US where our final goal is to find the eigenvalues of our correlation matrix of our data (i.e. the principal components). The way how we implemented the PCA technique was divided in four stages: i) Classical pre-processing, ii) State preparation, iii) Purity calculation, iv) Classical post-processing. After explaining each step with the mathematics and physics details needed, we implemented the quantum algorithm in two ways: first, via the Qiskit provider for Amazon Braket with a simplified quantum algorithm but with some limitations, and then with the local simulator and the Amazon Braket SV1 and Amazon Braket DM1 devices. Our results for the eigenvalue we we're looking for is the same we predicted using classical computation with a percent error less than 1%. Finally, we saw that for this particular scenario, PCA technique was correctly implemented using quantum algorithms, circuits and devices. However, we know the technology is still in an early stage, but proving that we can make these small steps brings hope and optimism for the future of quantum computing and its applications.
